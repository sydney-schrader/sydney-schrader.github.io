    <p class="giveheader">donors</p>
    <p class="givesubheader">your support is crucial</p>
    <p class="givefont">Donors are vital to Young Life at the local area and regional levels. Because Young Life areas are financially supported solely at the local level, donorsâ€™ financial gifts account for all of an area's budget and part of a region's budget. Your donation helps areas hire and train staff and provide essential administrative support to the area. Your contributions also support operating expenses such as salaries and other ministry costs and can help send kids to Young Life camps. The ministry of Young Life would not exist wihtout the generosity of people in our communities and we are grateful for each and every donation.<br><br></p>
     <p class="givesubheader">our vision</p>
